# **This is a project to build a dress catalog for the Reim Ahuvim Gemach.**

---
This is my הנדסת תוכנה (a.k.a Software Engineering) project for the final exams of 12th grade.
I'm building a website for a local dress Gemach which will provide the Gemach with a digital catalog of all the dresses available for borrowing, and will let the Gemach keep track of all the dresses, including those which are borrowed at the moment.

You are welcome to contribute for this Gemach's worthy cause, and donate your unused wedding dresses, or consider donating money to allow the Gemach to keep doing its great work.
